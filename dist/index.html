                <p>Milliways, better known as the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, is a five-star restaurant
                    situated at the end of time and matter. Its main attraction is allowing diners to view a Gnab Gib,
                    before desserts are served.</p>

                <p>The Restaurant has some of the most staggeringly extravagant decor ever seen, a variety of the
                    strangest guests from throughout history, and serves a particularly fine Pan Galactic Gargle
                    Blaster. Milliways is run by an incredible arrangement of life forms from everywhen, and is the one
                    place anywhen that serves talking food.</p>
                <img class="hero-img" src="../src/48845013383_7034907c88_3k.jpg" alt="">

                <p>Reservations are easily obtained, since they can be booked once the patron returns to his or her
                    original time after their meal, and the restaurant's bill can be paid by depositing a penny in any
                    bank account of the present time: by the end of the universe, the compound interest on that penny
                    over the course of time after 170 quintillion years (short scale) will be enough to pay the
                    extremely high bill. Near-instant transportation to the restaurant can be achieved in certain
                    rarefied circumstances, such as being next to an exploding hyperspatial field generator on the
                    planet where Milliways will eventually be built several billion years after the explosion occurs. Or
                    have access to a Infinite Improbability Drive, such as The Heart of Gold.</p>
